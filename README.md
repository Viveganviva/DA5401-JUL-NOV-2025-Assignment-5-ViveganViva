THE REPOSITORY CONTAINS A SINGLE PYTHON NOTEBOOK THAT HAS ALL THE CODE AND SERVES AS A REPORT AS WELL. THE HYPOTHESIS IS STATED IN THE FILE AND THE PLOTS, THE INFERENCES AND RESULTS ARE GIVEN IN THE MARKDOWN DESCRIPTION WITHIN THE NOTEBOOK. 

Note: Apologies for teh late submission. I hope this doesn't attract a huge penalty. The code was entirely hand written with no LLM assistance.
